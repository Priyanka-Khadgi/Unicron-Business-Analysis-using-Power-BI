## INTRODUCTION

This report provides analysis of unicorn companies across industries, regions, and key metrics including funding, valuation, and ROI. The dashboard facilitates stakeholders in tracking trends, identifying opportunities, and making informed decisions. The analysis covers 1072 unicorn companies across 15 industries and 6 continents. The dashboard provides comprehensive insights for stakeholders to navigate the unicorn landscape effectively.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Understanding the emergence and growth patterns of unicorn companies is crucial, but handling vast data on them is challenging. Hence, a simplified visualization tool is needed for informed decision-making.

The business problems addressed in this report are-

1. Which countries have the most unicorns? Are there any cities that appear to be industry hubs?
2. In which year did the highest number of unicorn companies emerge?
3. Which industry has the highest rate of unicorn company creation?
4. Among industries, which one has the highest valuation for both its companies and individual firms?
5. What is the typical timeframe for a company to achieve unicorn status?
6. Which unicorn companies/industries have had the biggest return on investment? 
7. Which industries are attracting the most investment (top 5 industries)?
8. How many investors are there? Which investor funded most of the unicorns?

## PROPOSED SOLUTION

I have developed an interactive dashboard using Power BI, leveraging advanced data visualization techniques to analyze and present key metrics related to unicorn companies. The dashboard provides stakeholders with a user-friendly interface to explore and interpret data, enabling them to uncover valuable insights into the unicorn landscape.
